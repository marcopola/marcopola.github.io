      <description>We Have Lost Even We have lost even this twilight.
No one saw us this evening hand in hand,
while the blue night dropped out of the world.
I have seen from my window,
the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops.
Sometimes a piece of sunburned like a coin between my hands.
I remembered you with my soul clenchedin the sadness of mine that you know.
Where were you then?</description>
