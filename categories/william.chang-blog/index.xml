      <description>Tonight I can write the saddest lines. Write, for example, The night is shattered,
and the blue stars shiver in the distance.
The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.
Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.
Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.
She loved me, and sometimes I loved her too.</description>

      <description>The Morning Is Full The morning is full of stormin the heart of summer.
The clouds travel like white handkerchiefs of goodbye,
the wind, traveling, waving them in its hands.
The numberless heart of the windbeating above our loving silence.
Orchestral and divine,
resounding among the treeslike a language full of wars and songs.
Wind that bears off the dead leaves with a quick raidand deflects the pulsing arrows of the birds.</description>

      <description>So That You Will Hear Me So that you will hear me,
my words sometimes grow thin,
as the tracks of the gulls on the beaches.
Necklace,
drunken bellfor your hands as smooth as grapes.
And I watch my words from a long way ,
They are more yours than mine.
They climb on my old suffering like ivy.
It climbs the same way on damp walls.
You are to blame for this cruel sport.</description>

      <description>We Have Lost Even We have lost even this twilight.
No one saw us this evening hand in hand,
while the blue night dropped out of the world.
I have seen from my window,
the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops.
Sometimes a piece of sunburned like a coin between my hands.
I remembered you with my soul clenchedin the sadness of mine that you know.
Where were you then?</description>
