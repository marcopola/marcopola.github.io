      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;emspemspemspemspemspemspemspi-like-for-you-to-be-still&#34;&gt;       &lt;strong&gt;I Like For You To Be Still&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  I like for you to be still:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  I as though you were absent, and you do not hear me far away and my voice does not touch you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  It seems as though your eyes had flown away, and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  As all things are filled with my soul, you emerge from the things, filled with my soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  You are like my soul, a butterfly of dream, and you are like the word Melancholy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  I like for you to be still, and you are still far away,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  It sounds as though you were lamenting, a butterfly cooing like a dove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  And you hear me from far away, and my voice does not reach you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Let me come to be still in you silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  And let me talk to you with your silence,that is bright as a lamp, simple as a ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  You are like the night, with its stillness and constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Your silence is that of a star, as remote and candid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  I like for you to be still:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  it is though you were absent, distant and full of sorrow as though you had died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  One word then, one smile, is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  And I am happy, happy that it&amp;rsquo;s not true.&lt;/p&gt;
